Whatever it takes to keep a Republican in that region then fine .
Good Mike. I always thought you were nothing but a yes-man, but you're really showing some backbone.
STILL….. a coward! He would have gone along with Trump but he was afraid of going to jail
He has done so much for our country, and held his own against the adversity of persons who bullied politics over science. He was someone we could trust had our best health interests in mind. Thank goodness we had him, and it will be scary to see him go, though he deserves a great retirement.
He deserves a bonus on his retirement pay for having to deal with Trump and all the nuts who threatened him. He was doing the very best he could with the information available and he still is. Thank God we had him!!!
We need more committed dedicated and caring public servants like Fauci! Thank you!
Presidential Medal of Freedom! Thank you, Dr Fauci!
There are times in our national history someone with rare courage and steadfastness provides us leadership we desperately need in a great crisis. In this pandemic he was that person. Thank you, sir.
Award the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
I don’t blame him not wanting to deal with Trump or a Trump clone in 2024.
Thank you for his lifetime of dedication to keeping us safe. Hopefully these years of peoples hatefulness won't diminish his certainty about all he has accomplished. I believe for certain that without him and those he worked with we would have been demolished by Ebola years ago
There is a way to talk and treat individuals, no matter their color.
It's not about crime or obedience, it's about the officer's desire for violence. As we've seen time and time again, it's comply AND die.
After reading the article, I’m wondering what transpired before the police officer took Christopher Shaw down. Was he resisting arrest or complying with the officer’s instructions.
Great awareness and a well thought out decision. Time people who are considered as role models took a stand against the endemic gun violence in the USA.
That is a very kind and human thing to do for others. He knows this is his brand as they say and he is aware of the harm to others he can be party to by using it. Good man, and anyone who thinks otherwise, thanks for showing your true self.
A mature, well thought out decision. I stand with AR on this.
Go Gators!
Well done. It’s a thoughtful thing to do.
And since this is Flori-DUH, I wonder if Governor DeathSentence will require him to keep his nickname.
Maybe change numbers, there are some who won't let it go.
Since it was the logo for his “apparel company”, he knew what it meant
Glad he changed it though
kudos to him, a thoughtful decision, speaks volumes about this man ... and a decision that in no way, shape, or form diminishes his prowess on the field
The only thing that I have a problem with, is the part where he implies that AR-15 was just his nickname chosen because of his initials and jersey number. Had he (or his management team) not intended his nickname to not be associated with the weapon, they wouldn't have added the rifle scope reticle to the logo. The association with the weapon was purely intentional, and saying anything else is just trying to cover up the fact that it was. Own it. Say you thought it'd be a good idea, but in light of new opinions, you decided that it is not who you want to be.
AR-15 is one of the best firearms used against criminals in a home invasion. Guns don't kill people kill, the criminals are able to get firearms 24/7, the gun laws does not work with them.
In our state, we vote by mail, no poll workers needed. Personalized ballot comes in the mail, postage paid envelope or drop off at a secure drop box.
Universal vote-by-mail. Several states use it, and it increases participation and makes election day easy-peasy.
Why are taxpayers even involved in helping political parties select their candidates?
Between Covid and what happened to those ladies in Georgia, its no surprise.
Never mind harassment and worse from the crazy trumpsters.
Exactly. Instead of writing constantly about how Biden and the Democrats can’t get anything done, perhaps you might mention occasionally that the Republicans do absolutely nothing for the American people and spend their time obstructing everything and abusing the rules to make sure democrats can’t get anything done.

It’s like you think the president has some sort of magic wand or something
The media ran with the sky is falling narrative around "inflation". The story is being covered by people either weren't around or barely aware of what happened in the 70s & 80s.
It’s easier to criticize than to give a thoughtful and detailed analysis. Try a compare and contrast with what was then and is now. Eye-opening as to what Biden has been able to accomplish in a whiny America.
Actually, the Biden admin could have done a lot to stop the Delta and Omicron waves. Instead they decided to focus on the economy, lied about the variants, and hundreds of thousands died.
Even reputable media outlets spend far too much time chasing the next sensational story to get more likes, comments or subscriptions. Print media in particular never properly anticipated the decline of print media and the advertising that funded it, so now you scramble along with all the others.
Going back to good, basic journalism would be a great start.
Joe Biden is behaving and fulfilling his duties much more in line with an historically 'normal' President. Biden is civil, respectful, thoughtful in his demeanor; his policies are very mainstream center-liberal.

It is again the taint of Trumpism that still hangs on the nation that many still think a president ought to be a loudmouth schnook every minute of every day to prove 'relevance' and/or 'toughness'. The corporate media itself is still influenced by this Trump pollution of the public discourse.

Yes, it is time to encourage a "return to normalcy" in the body politic -- President Biden is setting the example and good Americans who want to see the republic come together and solve its problems need to recognize that.
Results matter. Why is it that Republicans can get really unpopular things done even while in the minority and the Dems can't get anything done with all 3 branches. All they have are excuses.
I agree. The cable news just looks for conflict, controversy and shock.
Just the news please. Save the opinions for the opinion pages.
I have to agree. The whole democracy was almost dismantled by one term President and his corrupt guys. Hard for anyone to put it back in order and the Senate is dysfunctional. Media was not helpful!
I always thought it was his myriad of bad decisions!!
Polls continue to show that nearly 70% of Americans support a woman’s right to choose, along with 56% of Republicans.

But yet, we have a small minority ruling this country. Authoritarian government efforts continue to erode our constitutional democracy.
This is a violation of the will of the majority by a religious extremist minority.

The only demographic in America showing majority support for denying women bodily autonomy is white Evangelicals (i.e., Southern Baptists+). These are ppl who preach women have a "god-given responsibility" to "submit to the servant leadership" of men & to "nurture children." They swear loyalty to their church before their country & preach subjugation rather than equality. It's time for the majority to stop them - again.
Yet another WTF moment for the US system
If men got pregnant, there would be abortion vending machines.
As it should be. It is a state issue.
So let me get this straight. The attorney general of Louisiana thinks it’s enough that the right wingers in his state approve of the law to force the Louisiana courts to not rule on its constitutionality?
Our President went to Saudi Arabia to get them to produce more oil. Period. Let the diplomats handle everything else. Biden accomplished his goal. This is real world stuff and armchair diplomacy is easy.
Whatever the views ,khashoggi had been killed and the visit to Saudia has taken place !
Nature seeks a balance. There are far too many of us on this planet. Humans have no predators so our numbers keep increasing. Disease is the only way nature has to do dampen this.
When will we understand that battle with nature’s pathogens will never end. Nature has a bio lab like no other. We should concentrate on battling that versus each other.
To all the tinfoil hats - Marburg has been around since the late 1960's, they just identified new CASES of it
Shouldn’t the dude spraying the potentially contaminated person be in some protective gear as well.
Your text reads Marbrug, but the article reads Marburg.
Solve the problem close the borders in and out. This way it stays there and doesn’t spread
At this point I’m thinking if someone or someones could be deliberately spreading the gnarliest of diseases???
Some form of bio warfare?
Marburg is not a coronavirus. Marburg is a type of hemorrhagic fever. There is no cure or treatment and 90% of people will die. Make a joke of it all you want, it’s extremely serious and you do not want it to spread.
The new world order branch in Ghana is open for business
Climate change. All this was predicted decades ago... Floods, fire, drought and spread of disease. Can we please #ActonClimate already???
Conservatives: “we will
Prevent you from having access to an abortion.”

Everyone else: “Well we think that’s wrong but at least let’s agree on expanding access to birth control to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies altogether.”

Also Conservatives: “No. Can’t have that either.”
For a party that was screaming about "government death panels" just a decade ago, the GOP is suddenly really keen on the government controlling people's medical decisions.
I have insurance and still found it immensely difficult to get a birth control prescription during the pandemic when I wanted to avoid going into a doctor's office. And even once I got it, the pharmacy messed up the mail order details (and my insurance you HAVE to do mail order for birth control). It's insane.
Love it! Black on the Block
